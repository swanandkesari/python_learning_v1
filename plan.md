# Python Learning Plan

## Goal
To learn Python programming from basics to advanced concepts, including data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas, within one month.

## Schedule
- **Daily Commitment**: 2 hours
- **Total Duration**: 1 month

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Python Basics
- **Topics**:
  - Python syntax and variables
  - Data types (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
  - Control structures (if-else, loops)
  - Functions and modules
- **Practice**:
  - Write Python scripts for basic tasks
  - Solve simple problems using loops and conditionals

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Topics**:
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
  - Special methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`)
- **Practice**:
  - Create classes for real-world objects
  - Implement inheritance and polymorphism in examples

### Week 3: Data Handling and Visualization
- **Topics**:
  - Introduction to NumPy
  - Data manipulation with Pandas
  - Data visualization with Matplotlib
- **Practice**:
  - Analyze datasets using Pandas
  - Create plots and charts with Matplotlib

### Week 4: Advanced Topics and Projects
- **Topics**:
  - File handling
  - Exception handling
  - Regular expressions
  - Final project: Combine all learned concepts
- **Practice**:
  - Build a mini-project (e.g., data analysis tool)

## Guidelines
- Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8)
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Practice daily and review previous topics regularly

## Resources
- Python official documentation
- Online tutorials and courses
- Practice platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
