# Python Learning Roadmap

Welcome to your Python learning journey! This roadmap will guide you through the process of learning Python programming step-by-step. By the end of this journey, you will have a solid understanding of Python basics, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas.

# Learning Path

## Week 1: Python Basics
- **Topics**:
    - Python syntax and variables
    - Data types: strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
    - Control structures: if-else, loops
    - Functions and modules
- **Examples**:
    - Write a script to calculate the factorial of a number
    - Create a program to manage a to-do list

## Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Topics**:
    - Classes and objects
    - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
    - Special methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`)
- **Examples**:
    - Create a `BankAccount` class with deposit and withdrawal methods
    - Implement a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles

## Week 3: Data Handling and Visualization
- **Topics**:
    - Introduction to NumPy
    - Data manipulation with Pandas
    - Data visualization with Matplotlib
- **Examples**:
    - Analyze a CSV dataset using Pandas
    - Create a bar chart and a line graph using Matplotlib

## Week 4: Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Topics**:
    - Common data structures: stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs
    - Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort
    - Searching algorithms: binary search, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS)
- **Examples**:
    - Implement a stack and queue using Python
    - Solve problems using DFS and BFS on graphs

## Week 5: Design Patterns
- **Topics**:
    - Creational patterns: Singleton, Factory
    - Structural patterns: Adapter, Decorator
    - Behavioral patterns: Observer, Strategy
- **Examples**:
    - Implement a Singleton pattern for a configuration manager
    - Use the Strategy pattern to create a flexible payment system

## Week 6: Advanced Topics and Projects
- **Topics**:
    - File handling
    - Exception handling
    - Regular expressions
    - Final project: Combine all learned concepts
- **Examples**:
    - Write a program to parse and analyze a log file
    - Build a mini-project (e.g., data analysis tool)

# Guidelines
- Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8)
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Practice daily and review previous topics regularly
